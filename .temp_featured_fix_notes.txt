Planned changes to FeaturedProducts.jsx:
- Make grid default to 2 columns (grid-cols-2) so two cards appear even on very small screens.
- Reduce gap to gap-4.
- Reduce card padding from p-4 sm:p-6 to p-3 sm:p-4.
- Reduce image container height from h-48 md:h-56 to h-36 md:h-48.
- Reduce image max-h from max-h-40 md:max-h-48 to max-h-28 md:max-h-40.
- Reduce input width to w-12 and button px/y to smaller values.

If this overflows visually on desktop, we keep md and lg breakpoints as before.
